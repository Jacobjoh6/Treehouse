00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Today we are going to be climbing trees of different widths.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Starting with the thinnest, smallest tree we can find

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Moving up tp the biggest thickest one

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now this one i spretty thin.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we dont climb this

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this is not tree climbingt this is tree murder if we climb this

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
lets start with this nice thin tree here

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
as you can see its very fleible but surprisingly strong and will easily support your body weight
9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
if you keep it centered over the middle
